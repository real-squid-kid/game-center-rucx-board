# GAME CENTER RUCX Board

A tool for spectacular game choosing for Retro Game Gauntlet-like challenges.<br />
Inspired by http://s3kr.it/gauntlet.html

**Current executable is available at [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eddya4qwsfz3l65/RGGRouletteApp.exe?dl=0)**

## HOW TO USE<br />

Dump your games list at the text field and press Reread<br />
Press Reveal to reveal board spaces one at a time, press Start to just start the spinner.<br />
The Sound checkbox controls only those two buttons. Opening and Theme buttons work separately.<br />
Press STOP to stop the spinner. Alternatively you can focus it by clicking and dragging away and then stop it by pressing Space or Return.<br />
Press "Show Text" to show or hide board space labels.

If you use this app while streaming, it is advised to cover settings with a webcam, such as in a Press Your Luck game show.

## TO DO<br />
Reduce the size of executable by using MP3 instead of WAV (too lazy)<br />
Add support for OUT and BONUS squares (separate textbox for special squares maybe?)<br />
Add support for opening text files for lists (too lazy)<br />
Add scroll to text box (too lazy)<br />
Be less lazy
